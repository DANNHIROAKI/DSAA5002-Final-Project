# Baseline configurations used by:
#   python -m customer_segmentation.src.experiments.run_baselines
#
# Notes
# -----
# - These are *unsupervised* or weakly-supervised segmentation baselines.
# - The evaluation scripts split the raw rows first, then fit preprocessing only on the train split.
# - Cluster-then-Predict uses behaviour features for clustering and full features for the per-cluster classifier.
